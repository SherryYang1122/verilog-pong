<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="737" delta="old" >Found <arg fmt="%d" index="1">10</arg>-bit latch for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">v_count_next</arg>&gt;. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.

<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="737" delta="old" >Found <arg fmt="%d" index="1">8</arg>-bit latch for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">char_add</arg>&gt;.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2371" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="1767" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Resource sharing has identified that some arithmetic operations in this design can share the same physical resources for reduced device utilization. For improved clock frequency you may try to disable resource sharing.
